About
-----

DDLaunch is a frontend for DamienD's collection of Amiga games. It was 
designed to remove the need to use the WinUAE interface to start the games. It 
also adds filters and a bit of extra functionality as well.

Installation
------------
In the archive there are 32 and 64bit versions of the the executable which 
you can install depending on your OS. The DDLaunch file needs to be put in 
the WinUAE folder that was extracted from the DamienD collection archives. If 
you wish to use this help file in DDLaunch, copy it into the WinUAE folder as
well.

When you launch the program for the first time, it will create a database of 
the game folder and process the configuration files to make them compatible 
with the launcher. These are stored in DD_CONFIGS.dat and DD_DB.dat which are 
saved in the WinUAE folder. This process will take a few minutes.

Optional Files
--------------

DDlaunch has a built in file viewer that can show any support documents 
included with the games. Most formats are supported, but to view PDF files in 
the viewer, you will need to install Adobe Acrobat, FoxIt Pro or an equivalent 
web plugin. If a PDF plugin is not installed, the window will show a download 
popup and open the file in your default PDF reader.

Main Window
-----------

DDLaunch's GUI is fully resizeable and will remember the window location and 
size when closed. These settings are stored in the 'DD_Launch.prefs' file in the 
WinUAE folder. The media panel has a fixed ratio so the images are shown at 
the correct aspect.

The window is split into two sections, the configurations list and the media panel.

** Configuration List **
In the config list, you will see the list of installed games. To run a game, 
just double click it. You can also right click anywhere on the DDLaunch window 
and a popup menu will appear which also allows you to run the game, open the 
game folder or access any documentation that is in the game folder.

** Filter **
This drop-down menu allows you to filter the games list by category. Also,
pressing F10 will open a search window.

** Floppy Speed **
A lot of the games are run off of an emulated floppy disk. This option allows 
you to change the speed of the floppy drive.

** Media Panel **
In this panel you will see any game art supplied in the collection. You can
double click any of the panels to open them in a larger window. Double clicking
or pressing Escape will close the zoomed picture.

If the game has any extra documentation, you will see a document icon in the 
top right corner of the cover art panel. Use the popup menu to access these 
documents.
