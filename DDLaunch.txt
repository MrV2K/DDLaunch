About
-----

DDLaunch is a frontend for DamienD's collection of Amiga games. It was designed to
remove the need to use the WinUAE interface to start the games. It also adds
filters and a bit of extra functionality as well.

Installation
------------

In the archive there are 32 and 64bit versions of the the executable which you can
install depending on your OS. The DDLaunch file needs to be put in the WinUAE
folder that was extracted from the DamienD collection archives.

When you launch the program for the first time, it will create a database of the
game folder and process the configuration files to make them compatible with the
launcher. These are stored in DD_CONFIGS.dat and DD_DB.dat which are saved in the
WinUAE folder. This process will take a few minutes.

Optional Files
--------------

DDlaunch has a built in PDF viewer. For this to work properly you will need to
install Adobe Acrobat, FoxIt Pro or equivalent web plugin. If they are not
installed, the window will show a download popup and open the file in your default
PDF reader. 

Main Window
-----------

The main window is split into two sections, the game list and the media panel.

** Game List **
In the game list you will see the list of installed games. To run a game, just
double click it. You can also right click anywhere on the DDLaunch window and a
popup menu will appear which also allows you to run the game, open the game folder
or access any documentation that is in the game folder.

** Filter **
This drop-down menu allows you to filter the games list by category. Also,
pressing F10 will open a search window.

** Floppy Speed **
A lot of the games are run off of an emulated floppy disk. This option allows you
to change the speed of the floppy drive.

** Media Panel **
In this panel you will see any game art supplied in the collection. You can
double click any of the panels to open them in a larger window. Double clicking
or pressing Escape will close the zoomed picture.

If the game has any extra documentation, you will see a document icon in the top
right corner of the cover art panel. Use the popup menu to access these documents.
